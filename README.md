# Imago

Android app created for Summer Startup Tech using the Ionic framework

Imago is an app that helps people discover hidden gems around NYC. 
The user opens the scavenger hunt map and competes with friends to earn rewards as they learn fun facts.
They verify they are at the location by taking a picture, and using Imago recognition, we give them points on the leaderboard.
